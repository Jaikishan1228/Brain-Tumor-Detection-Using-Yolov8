# Brain Tumor Detection with YOLOv8

## Project Overview
This project uses the YOLOv8 object detection model to detect brain tumors in medical images. The workflow includes:
- Dataset preparation
- Model training
- Evaluation
- Inference on new images

All code and results are provided in the Jupyter notebook: `YOLOv8_BrainTumor_Training.ipynb`


## Model Performance & Metrics
The YOLOv8 model was custom trained on the BrainTumorYolov8 dataset for brain tumor detection. Below are the key performance metrics from the final epoch:

- **Validation mAP@0.5:** 0.9028
- **Validation mAP@0.5:0.95:** 0.6903
- **Validation Precision:** 0.8974
- **Validation Recall:** 0.8356
- **Validation Box Loss:** 0.9635
- **Validation Class Loss:** 0.7529
- **Validation DFL Loss:** 1.2078

These results indicate that the model achieves high accuracy in detecting and localizing brain tumors across the three classes (glioma, meningioma, pituitary). For detailed training curves and confusion matrices, see the plots in `yolov8_brain_tumor/exp1/`.

## How to Use
1. **Dataset Preparation**
   - The dataset is organized in YOLO format under `BrainTumor/BrainTumorYolov8/` with `train`, `valid`, and `test` splits.
   - The `data.yaml` file defines the dataset structure and class names.

2. **Model Training**
   - Run the notebook `YOLOv8_BrainTumor_Training.ipynb` to train the YOLOv8 model on the custom dataset.
   - Training outputs (weights, logs, plots) are saved in `yolov8_brain_tumor/exp1/`.
   - The best model is also saved as `models/yolov8_brain_tumor.pt`.

3. **Inference**
   - Use the notebook to run predictions on new images.
   - Results are saved in the `runs/cancer_detection*` folders.

4. **Visualization**
   - Training and validation results, confusion matrices, and sample predictions are available as images in `yolov8_brain_tumor/exp1/`.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
